<h2>The reason why I learn html</h2>
<p>Today, I start to learn <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/" target="_blank" title="html5 specification">HTML</a> as <strong><u>the first step</u> of achieving my goal.</strong>
  <br>My goal is making my own company. I don't decide the exact brand or genre,
  but it is certain that I sometime launch my own brand.</p>
  <img src="startup.jpg"width="100%">
  <p style="margin-top:40px;">The most important thing in lauching own brand is realize thing to real world that was originally only in my head.
    In making a website, I think the design and convenience is important.
    The design can show our brand's own style, such as our signiture color, motto, things that we want to show our users.</p>
